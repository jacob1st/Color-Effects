# Color-Effects
Messing around with different color filters

Most of these Filters are just tests, it's fun to change some of the functions run by the buttons to experiment with your own filter!

The top white button can be used to type in an RGB color with each value seperated by a comma. E.X "255, 255, 255" for white (without the quotation marks)
The bar by this field can be used to pick random color. The font will change to whatever color is selected.

The white grid on the left can be used to draw. The variables "width_of_pixel" and "width of grid" on lines 145 and 148 can be changed to alter the size of the grid.

Other than that, press the buttons labeled accrodingly to mess around adding filters!
